This project combines a custom-trained MNIST neural network with Mediapipe hand tracking.  
You can âœ‹ use your hand as a pen to draw digits in the air, and the model will predict the digit in real-time.

## Features
- Model trained on mnist 
- Detects âœ‹ open palm (stop) and ðŸ‘† index finger (draw).
- Converts finger drawings into 28Ã—28 MNIST-style images for prediction.
- Shows predicted digit live on the video feed.

## Instructions to use live recognition
- Pinch your index finger to start drawing.
- Open your palm to stop and predict the digit.
- Press ESC to exit.
